            The outlook for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) remains highly promising, driven by escalating demands for renewable energy storage and electric vehicles (EVs). 
            The global LIB market is projected to grow significantly, with an anticipated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% from 2023 to 2030, primarily driven by the EV industry's expansion and grid-scale energy storage solutions (BloombergNEF, 2023).

          Q1: Global lithium resources are mainly concentrated in the Lithium Triangle, Western Australia, China and North America, and trade flows are concentrated to the three East Asian countries, making the global supply chain highly dependent on these two regions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Q2:
           Lithium batteries connect South American raw materials with global end-consumption, with China dominating processing and exports, and developed countries relying on their imports to complete vehicle assemblies.
          </p>

        <p>
          Q3: 
          The South American lithium triangle provides raw materials, China's three coastal provinces lead refining and assembly, and global automakers are responsible for manufacturing and selling the end products.

        </p>

        <p>
          Answer to Main RQ:
          The geographical concentration and trade flow of the lithium supply chain determines the unbalanced pattern of the EV industry in terms of technological dominance and market layout, affecting the strategic deployment of the global industry.
